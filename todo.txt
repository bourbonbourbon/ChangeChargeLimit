shutdown g-helper, change the config and start it again

only elevate privilege at a later stage

check if "%APPDATA\\ChangeChargeLimitPy" is there or not
    if it isn't then create the folder
    check if the config file is there or not
        if it isn't then create a basic config file with basic values
            in the config file check if the days and time are correct
            use 24 hr clock

create an elevated process which has the code to elevated/create process to restart g-helper and  and an unelevated process which has the code for getting and setting the config files

always run the process on system startup

create executable using github actions, turn on security checks as well

add a  disclaimer to the project stating that it is their responsibility running this code and that I take none of it if it ends up breaking their system etc.

config_creator_helper.py
    cli tool to create the config file and save it as well
